A new Docker image is available for training *Keras image segmentation* models using a GPU backend. 
The image is based on TensorFlow 1.14 and Divam Gupta's `code <https://github.com/divamgupta/image-segmentation-keras>`__, 
plus additional tools for converting indexed PNGs into RGB ones and continuously processing images with a model.

More information on the Docker image is available from Github:
