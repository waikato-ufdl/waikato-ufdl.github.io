The first Docker images are available for the `MMDetection <https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection>`__ object detection framework, using the 2019-11-30 code base (close to 1.0rc1) of MMDetection:

`github.com/waikato-datamining/mmdetection/tree/master/2019-11-30 <https://github.com/waikato-datamining/mmdetection/tree/master/2019-11-30>`__

MMDetection is based on `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/>`__ rather than TensorFlow and offers a larger number of pre-trained models and example configurations than TensorFlow's Object Detection API. It is developed by the Multimedia Laboratory of the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
