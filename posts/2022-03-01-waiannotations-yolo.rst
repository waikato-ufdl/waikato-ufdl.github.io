The newly released `wai.annotations.yolo <https://github.com/waikato-ufdl/wai-annotations-yolo>`__ module for the
`wai.annotations <https://github.com/waikato-ufdl/wai-annotations>`__ library allows the reading and writing of
annotations in a format used by the popular YOLO network architectures.

The wai.annotations release `0.7.4 <https://github.com/waikato-ufdl/wai-annotations/releases/tag/v0.7.4>`__ has
this new module as dependency (as well as the wai.annotations.imgaug module released last week).
