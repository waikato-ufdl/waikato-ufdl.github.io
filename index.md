## Welcome to UFDL

The world, and particularly New Zealand, is experiencing a shortage
of deep learning specialists, and it is unlikely that this will change soon: recent developments have
shown that our modern, data-rich world consistently provides new opportunities for machine
learning to increase productivity and yield better decision-making. Potential applications proliferate,
for example, in the agritech sector, and need to be tackled with a high degree of immediacy so that
industry remains competitive. Access to deep learning technology for industry and research
institutions wishing to develop their own applications is compromised by the need for expert
knowledge in deep learning architectures and algorithms, and the difficulty of developing deep
learning models for new domains outside standard application areas such as object recognition,
text classification, and speech recognition. Currently, for organisations to successfully apply deep
learning to their data, substantial expertise in deep learning techniques must be available in
addition to domain expertise required to label examples for machine learning. Moreover, because
domain experts are not directly involved in applying machine learning algorithms, opportunities for
reducing the number of expert-provided labels by more directly guiding the learning algorithm may
be lost. This is a problem because an expert's time is often very valuable.

The goal of this project is to enable domain experts to
apply deep learning without involving a machine learning expert and without requiring any
programming, while minimising the amount of data labeling required. Our hypothesis is that a
carefully designed software platform that engages the end-user in the deep learning process
through an interactive graphical user interface (GUI), automates model selection and parameter
tuning, and does not require any programming, will enable access to deep learning technology for
a much wider sector of the economy. Moreover, enabling end-users to build predictive models
directly without involving deep learning experts will yield more accurate solutions in less time. Our
software will be developed by building on work in human-computer interaction, model visualisation,
meta learning, active learning, semi-supervised learning, and automatic model selection. We
propose a two-phase process. In the first phase, semi-supervised model selection based on meta
learning will be applied to choose and adapt a suitable model for the target domain from a library of
models garnered from related domains (a model *zoo*). A small amount of initial expert-labeled
data will be required in this phase. In the second phase, semi-supervised active learning will be
applied to enable the expert to interactively improve the accuracy of this initial model. To achieve
this algorithmically, semi-supervised model selection and robust semi-supervised active learning
are the main research problems to be tackled.
