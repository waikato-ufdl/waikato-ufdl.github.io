An experimental user interface for image classification is now available:

.. thumbnail:: ../../images/html_frontend_202104.png

The interface is written in `React <https://reactjs.org/>`__ and allows the
user to incrementally improve their models until they are happy with the
performance (**human in the loop**).

You can find out how to access this interface on the `Getting started <link://slug/getting-started>`__ page.
